# Git-Initialize 
#### Git Initalize consists of 2 files, one a bat file for execution on windows and one a bash file for linux.
#### > Before using GitCreate to initialize a folder, Make sure you have a repository created on github with the same name as your project.

### Usage
###### Add the folder where you have the file stored in, into your path. Open a terminal in the directory you want to initialize git in. Run
```batch
::Windows
GitCreate.bat

::Linux
chmod +x GitCreate.sh
bash GitCreate.sh
```
##### Enter prompt information and if your git commandline credentials are correct same as your repo name then it will initialize git in said folder and push a readme file to the repository. You can then commit the rest of files to the repository.
